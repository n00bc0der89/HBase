# HBase
Java code using HBase API to create table in MapRDB and second program to Put value into existing table and fetch back record.
Coding done on eclipse on windows Host machine and tested on MapR sandbox.
Needs MapR client to be downloaded and put into windows C:/opt/mapr. Then run configure.bat file for code to read from MapR FS.
(Without MapR client was getting error)
